# Chopsticks

Chopsticks is a Docker-first, self-hosted Discord bot platform with:
- a main control bot
- pooled agent bots for voice/music workloads
- PostgreSQL + Redis state
- Lavalink for audio
- optional dashboard + monitoring stack
- optional ops cockpit (live container logs)

This repository is designed to be safe to publish: configuration is externalized, tests enforce core pooling invariants, and the stack is runnable end-to-end in Docker.

## Platform Snapshot (2026-02-15)

- Maturity baseline: Levels 0-2 hardening in progress/completed artifacts are in-repo
- Agent protocol version: `1.0.0`
- Max agents per guild: `49` (enforced)
- Contract/unit tests: `90 passing`
- Primary runtime target: Docker Compose production stack
- Moderation suite: hardened embed outputs + guardrails + interactive purge

See `docs/status/SYSTEM_STATUS.md`, `docs/status/MATURITY.md`, `docs/reports/LEVEL_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`, and `docs/reports/LEVEL_2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for detailed status.

## Making This Repo Public (Checklist)

1. **Remove secrets from git history**
   - Never commit `.env` files.
   - If you ever pasted tokens/keys into chat/issues/commits, treat them as compromised and rotate.
2. **Use examples only**
   - Use `.env.example` / `.env.comprehensive.example` as templates.
3. **Review licensing and trademarks**
   - `LICENSE` governs code use and redistribution.
   - `TRADEMARKS.md` governs the "Chopsticks" name and branding.
4. **Security + abuse posture**
   - `SECURITY.md` (responsible disclosure)
   - `docs/ACCEPTABLE_USE.md`
5. **Run CI-equivalent verification**
   - `npm test`
   - `docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml build && docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`

## Architecture

Core services in `docker-compose.production.yml`:
- `bot` (`chopsticks-bot`): main Discord bot, command/control, health + metrics
- `agents` (`chopsticks-agents`): agent runner for pooled music/voice bots
- `postgres` (`chopsticks-postgres`): persistent relational state
- `redis` (`chopsticks-redis`): cache/session acceleration
- `lavalink` (`chopsticks-lavalink`): audio backend
- `dashboard` (`chopsticks-dashboard`): web dashboard (profile: `dashboard`)
- `caddy` (`chopsticks-caddy`): reverse proxy/TLS (profile: `dashboard`)
- `prometheus` (`chopsticks-prometheus`): metrics scrape/storage (profile: `monitoring`)
- `dozzle` (`chopsticks-dozzle`): live logs cockpit for all containers (profile: `ops`)

## Quick Start (Docker)

1. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set at minimum: DISCORD_TOKEN, BOT_OWNER_IDS, POSTGRES_URL, REDIS_URL
```

2. Start platform (one command):
```bash
make start
# or:
./scripts/ops/chopsticksctl.sh up
```

`chopsticksctl up` does:
- compose up (with `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, default `dashboard,monitoring,fun`)
- waits for bot `/health`
- runs migrations
- deploys slash commands to your guild (if `DEV_GUILD_ID`/`GUILD_ID` is set in `.env`)

Optional toggles:
- `CHOPSTICKS_AUTO_BUILD=true` to build images before starting
- `CHOPSTICKS_DEPLOY_GLOBAL=true` to also deploy global commands

By default, production bring-up enables profiles:
- `dashboard`
- `monitoring`
- `fun` (FunHub API on `:8790`)

To override:
```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=dashboard ./scripts/start.sh
```

3. Verify runtime:
```bash
make status
make health
make logs
```

4. Stop platform:
```bash
make stop
```

## 24/7 Hosting (systemd)

On a Linux host, install the systemd service + watchdog timer:
```bash
sudo bash scripts/ops/install-systemd.sh
```

This keeps the Docker stack running in the background and periodically self-heals via `scripts/ops/chopsticks-watchdog.sh`.

## Token Encryption Key Rotation (Important)

If you change `AGENT_TOKEN_KEY`, previously stored agent tokens become undecryptable.
Chopsticks will mark those identities as unusable and you must re-register them (e.g. re-run `/agents add_token` for each identity).

## Music + Agent Pooling

Typical setup flow in Discord:
1. Register agent tokens into a pool (`/agents add_token`)
2. Mark tokens active (`/agents update_token_status`)
3. Deploy identities into guild (`/agents deploy <count>`)
4. Start playback (`/music play <query>`)

Operational notes:
- Agent runner requires `AGENT_CONTROL_URL` and Lavalink env (`LAVALINK_HOST`, `LAVALINK_PORT`, `LAVALINK_PASSWORD`)
- Agent readiness is required for music allocation
- If all agents are busy, deploy more or retry after session release
- Idle auto-release controls:
  - `AGENT_SESSION_IDLE_RELEASE_MS` (default `1800000` = 30 minutes)
  - `AGENT_SESSION_IDLE_SWEEP_MS` (default `60000` = 1 minute)
  - Server admins can override per-guild with `/agents idle_policy`
  - On idle timeout with no humans in VC, session is released and deployer/session owner is notified

## VoiceMaster (Auto Rooms)

Voice lobby system supports:
- auto-create temp rooms from lobby channels
- owner handoff/claim/transfer lifecycle
- per-lobby owner permission templates (`Manage Channels`, `Move Members`, `Mute/Deafen`, `Priority Speaker`)
- interactive VC control console (`/voice console`) with buttons + dropdowns
- live dynamic room panel (`/voice room_panel`) that refreshes with room events
- room controls (`/voice room_status`, `/voice room_rename`, `/voice room_limit`, `/voice room_lock`, `/voice room_unlock`, `/voice room_release`, `/voice room_claim`, `/voice room_transfer`)
- room dashboard delivery controls:
  - manual `/voice panel`
  - user default `/voice panel_user_default`
  - guild default `/voice panel_guild_default`
  - delivery modes: `temp`, `dm`, `channel`, `here`, `both`, `off`

## Custom VCs (Panel Rooms, In Development)

Custom VCs are a separate system from VoiceMaster. They let members request an on-demand voice channel with:
- public/private privacy
- private guestlists
- deny-join and deny-speak restrictions
- size and bitrate controls

Admin commands:
- `/voice customs_setup` (enable + configure)
- `/voice customs_panel` (post the request panel)
- `/voice customs_status` (status)

## Bot-wide UI

- `/commands ui` opens an interactive command center with category and command dropdowns.
- `/fun play`, `/fun random`, and `/fun catalog` provide a 220-variant fun system (also available as prefix `!fun`).
- `/fun settings` controls auto output mode and feature routing in your guild (`mode: off|clean|creative`, plus `welcome|giveaway|daily|work`).
- Most commands use standardized embed outputs, and (in production) embed cards are rendered as high-quality images (see `SVG_CARDS`).

## Game (Discord)

- `/gather` runs a loot mission and returns a professional card image + embed.
- `/work` earns Credits and returns a professional card image + embed.
- `/inventory`, `/collection`, `/vault` show your progress.
- `/trivia solo` runs a solo round (no opponents).
- `/trivia versus @user` runs a PvP match (opponent must accept).
- `/trivia start` runs a duel against a deployed agent with a lobby + countdown + dropdown answers.
- `/trivia fleet` runs a match against multiple deployed agents.
- `/agent chat` lets users chat with a deployed agent identity (optional local LLM).
- `/profile` now includes progression, economy, inventory, command usage, and activity sections.
  - Users can set visibility controls directly in `/profile` (privacy preset + per-section toggles).
  - Default privacy is show-all.

## Moderation Hardening

The moderation command surface is hardened and standardized:
- Professional embed outputs for moderation commands
- Target safety guardrails (self/owner/admin/hierarchy/bot checks)
- `/purge` preview + confirmation buttons + dry-run mode
- Filtered purge options (`user`, `contains`, `links`, `attachments`, `bots_only`, `include_pinned`)
- Purge supports mixed-age delete strategy (bulk for recent messages, manual fallback for older messages)

## FunHub API

`funhub` is the external API layer for the same fun engine used by `/fun` and `!fun`.

- Base URL: `http://localhost:8790`
- Health: `GET /health`
- Authenticated endpoints:
  - `GET /api/fun/catalog?q=<query>&limit=<1-25>`
  - `GET /api/fun/random?actor=<name>&target=<name>&intensity=<1-5>`
  - `GET /api/fun/render?variant=<id>&actor=<name>&target=<name>&intensity=<1-5>`
  - `GET /api/fun/pack?count=<1-10>&actor=<name>&target=<name>&intensity=<1-5>`

Security controls:
- API key auth enabled by default (`FUNHUB_REQUIRE_API_KEY=true`)
- Bot uses `FUN_PROVIDER=auto` and attempts FunHub first, with local fallback
- Rate limit defaults: `120 requests / 60s` per API key
- Optional CORS allowlist via `FUNHUB_CORS_ORIGINS`

Recommended env:
```bash
FUN_PROVIDER=auto
FUNHUB_URL=http://funhub:8790
FUNHUB_INTERNAL_API_KEY=<long-secret-key>
FUNHUB_API_KEYS=<comma-separated-extra-keys>
FUNHUB_CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-dashboard.example
FUNHUB_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=120
FUNHUB_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
```

## Testing

Run full unit/contract tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Maturity-focused checks:
```bash
make test-level-0
make test-level-1

```
