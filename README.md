## Overview

Chopsticks is a full-featured Discord bot built on [discord.js v14](https://discord.js.org) with PostgreSQL persistence, Redis caching, and a Lavalink audio backend. It ships 70 slash commands across music, moderation, economy, games, AI, and social features — all configurable per-server via `/setup`.

The flagship feature is the **Agent Pool System**: a community model where multiple Discord bot tokens are pooled, encrypted, and dispatched to voice channels on demand. Servers never manage tokens directly; they consume from shared pools maintained by the community.

**Hosted instance:** Invite Chopsticks to your server — no self-hosting required.
> Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the bot's application ID: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

---

## Features

**Music** — Lavalink-backed audio with full queue management. Play from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, or direct URLs. Supports drag-and-drop audio file playlists via the playlist drop channel.

**Moderation** — Ban, kick, mute, warn, timeout, and purge with preview + confirmation dialogs. Filtered purge by user, content type, links, or attachments. Hierarchy safety prevents actions above the invoker's rank. Full mod log integration.

**Economy** — Server credits earned through daily claims, work, gathering, and quests. Shop, inventory, vault, crafting, auctions, heist, and trading. Per-guild XP and leveling system with configurable multipliers, cooldowns, and level-up announcements.

**Stats & Achievements** — Per-user activity tracking across VC time, messages, commands, casino wins, trades, and streaks. Leaderboards, profile cards (canvas-rendered), and an achievement system with unlock tracking.

**AI & Image Generation** — Chat with AI models via `/ai chat`. Generate images with HuggingFace FLUX.1-schnell (free tier) via `/ai image`. Bring AI assistants into voice channels through the agent pool.

**Agent Economy** — Spend server credits to deploy agents: have a bot join a voice channel, play a sound, send a message, run trivia, or greet users. Server admins configure available actions and costs via `/setup`.

**Games & Social** — Trivia (PvP, fleet, agent-duel modes), truth or dare, would you rather, battles, riddles, reputation, ship, dad jokes, urban dictionary lookup, and more.

**Server Management** — Reaction roles, auto-role, welcome messages, starboard, polls, giveaways, ticket system, scheduled messages, automation scripts, birthday tracking, suggestion channel, slow mode, lockdown, and embed builder.

**Dashboard** — Web-based guild configuration panel (OAuth2), real-time dev dashboard with Socket.io push, Prometheus metrics, and Grafana integration.

## Agent Pool System

The Agent Pool System is Chopsticks' flagship feature. Multiple Discord bot tokens are pooled by community contributors, encrypted at rest, and dispatched on demand to serve voice and assistant workloads.

### Architecture

```
Your Server ──► Guild Pool Config ──► Primary Pool (+ up to 2 Secondary Pools)
                                              │
                    ┌─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┐
                    ▼                         ▼                          ▼
               Agent Bot #1             Agent Bot #2              Agent Bot #3
               (music)                  (voice_assistant)          (utility)
```

Agents are connected Discord bot clients, each authenticated with a token contributed by a pool member. The runner process polls the database every 10 seconds, starts agents for active tokens, and establishes a WebSocket connection to the AgentManager control plane. Guilds dispatch work through the manager via session routing.

### Security Model

| Mechanism | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Token encryption | AES-256-GCM with per-pool HKDF-SHA256 derived keys |
| Token exposure | Only masked form (`BOT_***...***_xyz`) ever appears in logs or embeds |
| Revocation | `token = NULL` in the database; status flags alone are not trusted |
| Access control | Pool management operations are owner-only, gated in all command paths |
| Rate limiting | Write operations throttled per-user to prevent enumeration and abuse |
| Runner authentication | Optional `AGENT_RUNNER_SECRET` validates runner identity on hello handshake |

### Pool Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Pool | A named collection of up to 49 bot tokens, owned by one user |
| Agent | A contributed bot token, active after pool-owner approval |
| Specialty | Music, voice assistant, utility, relay, or custom — matched to guild preference |
| Tier | Free / Pro / Enterprise — controls per-pool capacity and priority |
| Alliance | Two pools linked for cross-discovery and the Allied badge |
| Contribution | A token submitted by a non-owner; requires explicit pool-owner approval |
