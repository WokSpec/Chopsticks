# Agent Pool Setup - Ownership & Customization

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Pool Ownership ✅
**Problem:** The default pool had owner "system" and tokens had no owner.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Set you as the pool owner
UPDATE agent_pools SET owner_user_id = '1122800062628634684' WHERE pool_id = 'default';

-- Set you as the owner of all tokens
UPDATE agent_bots SET owner_user_id = '1122800062628634684' WHERE owner_user_id IS NULL;
```

**Result:** You can now remove/manage tokens in your pool!

---

### 2. Customized Pool Name & Description ✅
**Before:**
- Name: "Default Pool"
- Description: "Chopsticks default agent pool"

**After:**
- Name: "**goot27's Agent Pool**"
- Description: "**Voice AI agent pool hosted by goot27**"

---

### 3. Added Pool Edit Command ✅
You can now change your pool name and description anytime!

**Command:**
```
/agents pool_edit
  [pool_id: optional - defaults to your guild's pool]
  [name: new display name]
  [description: new description]
```

**Examples:**
```
/agents pool_edit name:"goot27's Premium Pool" description:"Elite voice AI agents"
/agents pool_edit name:"The Goot Pool"
/agents pool_edit description:"Professional AI voice services by goot27"
```

---

## Current Pool Info:

```
Pool ID:     default
Name:        goot27's Agent Pool

Owner:       goot27 (1122800062628634684)

## Technical Details:

**Database Schema:**
```sql
agent_pools:
- pool_id: text (primary key)
- name: text (display name)
- description: text (optional description)
- visibility: text (public/private)
- owner_user_id: text (Discord user ID)
- max_agents: integer (49)
- created_at: bigint
- updated_at: bigint
```

**Authorization Logic:**
```javascript
// Can modify pool if:
1. You are the pool owner (owner_user_id matches)
2. You are a bot admin (bot application owner/team member)

// Can remove token if:
1. You can modify the pool (above rules)
2. You own the specific token (token.owner_user_id matches)
```

## Future Enhancements:

Consider adding:
- Pool member management (invite others to contribute tokens)
- Pool transfer (change ownership)
- Token usage analytics
- Pool branding (custom colors/logos)
- Pool sharing/marketplace
